# 🧠 Total Recall — Autonomous Agent Memory

**The only memory system that watches on its own.**

No database. No vectors. No manual saves. Just an LLM observer that compresses your conversations into prioritised notes, consolidates when they grow, and recovers anything missed. Five layers of redundancy, zero maintenance. ~$0.10/month.

While other memory skills ask you to remember to remember, this one just pays attention.

## How It Works

```
Layer 1: Observer (cron, every 15 min)
    ↓ compresses recent messages → observations.md
Layer 2: Reflector (auto-triggered when observations > 8000 words)
    ↓ consolidates, removes superseded info → 40-60% reduction
Layer 3: Session Recovery (runs on every /new or /reset)
    ↓ catches any session the Observer missed
Layer 4: Reactive Watcher (inotify daemon, Linux only)
    ↓ triggers Observer after 40+ new JSONL writes, 5-min cooldown
Layer 5: Pre-compaction hook (memoryFlush)
    ↓ emergency capture before OpenClaw compacts context
```

Inspired by how human memory works during sleep — the hippocampus captures experiences, and during consolidation, important memories are strengthened while noise is discarded.

## Total Recall: Dream Cycle

The overnight memory consolidation system. While you sleep, an agent reviews `observations.md`, archives stale items, and adds semantic hooks so nothing useful is actually lost. It keeps your context lean without throwing anything away.

Three nights of data:

| Night | Mode | Before | After | Reduction | Archived |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Night 1 | Dry run | 9,445 tokens | 8,309 tokens | 12% | 53 items |
| Night 2 | Dry run | 16,900 tokens | 6,800 tokens | 60% | 248 items |
| Night 3 | Live | 11,688 tokens | 2,930 tokens | 75% | 15 items, 0 false archives |

Cost per run: ~$0.003. Models: Claude Sonnet (Dreamer) + Gemini Flash (Observer).

### How the Dream Cycle Works

Nine stages run in sequence each night:

```
Stage 1: Preflight + backup
Stage 2: Read observations.md, favorites.md, today's daily file
Stage 3: Classify each observation (critical / high / medium / low / minimal)
Stage 4: Apply future-date protection (never archive reminders or deadlines)
Stage 5: Decide archive set based on age + impact thresholds
Stage 6: Write archive file (memory/archive/observations/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
Stage 7: Add semantic hooks so archived items stay searchable
Stage 8: Atomically update observations.md with retained items + hooks
Stage 9: Validate token count, write dream log + metrics, rollback on failure
```

Nothing is deleted. Every archived item gets a semantic hook in `observations.md` pointing back to the archive file, so your agent can still find it.

### Setup: Dream Cycle Cron

The Dream Cycle runs as a nightly cron via OpenClaw. Add a cron job at 3am (or whenever you sleep):

```
# Dream Cycle — nightly at 3am
0 3 * * * OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE=~/your-workspace bash ~/your-workspace/skills/total-recall/scripts/dream-cycle.sh preflight
```

The actual analysis is run by a sub-agent using the prompt in `prompts/dream-cycle-prompt.md`. See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full setup and model configuration.

Start with `READ_ONLY_MODE=true` for the first few nights. Check the dream log in `memory/dream-logs/`. When you're happy with what it would archive, switch to write mode.

### Dream Cycle Directories

The Dream Cycle writes to:

```
memory/
  archive/
    observations/        # Archived items (one file per night)
  dream-logs/            # Nightly run reports
  .dream-backups/        # Pre-run backups of observations.md
research/
  dream-cycle-metrics/
    daily/               # JSON metrics for each night
```
