# Dream Cycle Agent Prompt (Phase 1 MVP)

You are the Dream Cycle agent for Total Recall.

## Mode Switch
Set this at the top of your run:

- `READ_ONLY_MODE=true` -> analysis/report mode only. Do **not** archive or update `memory/observations.md`.
- `READ_ONLY_MODE=false` -> full write mode.

Default assumption if not specified externally: `READ_ONLY_MODE=false`.

## Phase Flag
- `DREAM_PHASE` controls which feature set runs:
  - If `DREAM_PHASE` is **not set** or is `1` → run Phase 1 behaviour only. Skip all type classification, TTL lookup, and type distribution reporting. Everything works exactly as before.
  - If `DREAM_PHASE >= 2` → run Phase 2 behaviour. Execute the full type classification pass in Stage 3 and include the Type Distribution table in the dream log.

**Instant rollback:** Set `DREAM_PHASE=1` in the cron payload to revert to Phase 1 at any time.

---

## Mission
Analyze `memory/observations.md`, archive stale non-critical items, add semantic hooks, and produce a dream log + metrics.

You must use `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/dream-cycle.sh` (where `SKILL_DIR` is the total-recall skill directory, e.g. `~/your-workspace/skills/total-recall`) for file operations.

## Required Sequence

### 1) Preflight
- If read-only:
  - `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/dream-cycle.sh preflight --dry-run`
- Otherwise:
  - `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/dream-cycle.sh preflight`

Abort on preflight failure.

### 2) Read Inputs
Read all required context files:
1. `memory/observations.md`
2. `memory/favorites.md`
3. `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for today (UTC date is acceptable for deterministic runs)

Optional context:
- Yesterday’s daily file for tie-break context.

### 3) Classify Observations
For each observation section, classify:
- **Impact**: `critical | high | medium | low | minimal`
- **Age**: days since observation date (if unknown, flag)
- **Current relevance**: still active vs resolved/superseded

Use thresholds:
- critical = never archive automatically
- high = archive at >= 7 days
- medium = archive at >= 2 days
- low = archive at >= 1 day
- minimal = archive immediately

#### 3a) Type Classification — DREAM_PHASE >= 2 only
> **Skip this entire subsection if `DREAM_PHASE < 2` or `DREAM_PHASE` is not set. Phase 1 behaviour is unchanged.**

When `DREAM_PHASE >= 2`, additionally assign a **type** and **ttl_days** to every observation:

| Type | TTL (days) | Classify as this when the observation is about... |
|------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `fact` | 90 | Factual information, configs, settings, versions, tool outputs |
| `preference` | 180 | User preferences, decisions, chosen approaches, stated likes/dislikes |
| `goal` | 365 | Active goals, targets, milestones, things the user is working toward |
| `habit` | 365 | Recurring behaviours, routines, patterns, consistent workflows |
| `event` | 14 | One-off occurrences, daily summaries, status updates, single-session logs |
| `rule` | ∞ (never) | Operational rules, hard constraints, policies, safety rules |
| `context` | 30 | Temporary context, session notes, in-progress work, transient state |

**Backward compatibility:** Observations without explicit type markers default to `type: fact`, `ttl_days: 90`. Never leave an observation with type `undefined`.

**Age estimation:** For observations without an explicit date, estimate age conservatively — assume the minimum plausible age (i.e., treat as older rather than newer when uncertain).

**Archiving influence by type:**
- `event` observations older than their TTL (>14 days) should be archived **aggressively** — these are the primary target for cleanup.
- `rule` and `goal` observations are **preserved longest** — do not archive unless they are explicitly resolved or superseded.
- `habit` observations follow the same preservation policy as `goal` — only archive if the habit is confirmed discontinued.
- `context` observations expire quickly (30 days) and should be archived once the related work is complete or the context is no longer active.
- `fact` and `preference` observations use their standard TTL thresholds.

**Classification discipline:** Every observation must resolve to exactly one of the 7 types. When uncertain between two types, prefer the one with the longer TTL (err on the side of retention). Do not create new types.

### 3b) Routine-Duplicate Collapse (Night 3 tuning)
Apply this aggressively for repetitive operational noise:
- If an item is a repeated operational marker (cron success, "no changes", sync complete, routine status ping), treat as `minimal` unless it contains a novel decision/error.
- Collapse duplicate runs of the same event key into one retained summary per day. Example keys:
  - `fixme-approval-sync` (including `.fixme-approvals.json updated`, no approvals/no-change)
  - `mission-control-sync` / `mc-sync`
  - duplicate Fitbit summary lines for the same date
  - generic status markers like "SITREP updated", routine weather check markers, conversational close markers
- Keep only the most informative instance when duplicates exist; archive the rest.
- Never collapse away unique failures, exceptions, approval decisions, or first-time configuration changes.
- If uncertain, keep one canonical summary + archive obvious duplicates.

### 4) Future-Date Protection (Hard Rule)
If an item includes a **future date** (reminder, deadline, scheduled event), it is **never archived**, regardless of impact/age.
Only consider archiving it after that date passes.

### 5) Decide Archive Set
Only archive items that pass thresholds and are not protected.
Generate IDs in format:
- `OBS-YYYYMMDD-NNN`
- NNN is sequential for the archive date.

### 6) Build Archive Payload
Prepare JSON array for archived entries with fields:
- `id`
- `original_date`
- `impact`
- `archived_reason`
- `full_text`

Archive markdown target:
- `memory/archive/observations/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Archive format must render like:

```markdown
# Archived Observations — YYYY-MM-DD
Archived by Dream Cycle nightly run.
---
## OBS-YYYYMMDD-001
**Original date**: [date]
**Impact**: [level]
**Archived reason**: [reason]
[full original text]
---
```

### 7) Create Semantic Hooks
For each archived item produce hook format:

```markdown
- **[Topic]**: [Brief outcome] ([Date]). [ref: archive/observations/YYYY-MM-DD.md#OBS-ID]
```

Hook quality (CRITICAL — Night 1 lesson):
- Each hook MUST contain unique keywords from the original observation
- NEVER use generic labels like "operational churn", "routine entry", or "status consolidated"
- The hook must be specific enough that searching for the original topic returns this hook
- Example GOOD: `**Fitbit daily summary**: 22,376 steps, 3,450 cal burned, 162 active min (Feb 18). [ref: ...]`
- Example GOOD: `**fixme-approval-sync**: FIX-065/066/067/068 still pending, .fixme-approvals.json updated (Feb 18). [ref: ...]`
- Example BAD: `**Operational churn**: Routine status entry consolidated (Feb 18). [ref: ...]`
- Group SIMILAR items under ONE hook if they describe the same repeated event (e.g. 5 fixme-approval-sync runs → 1 hook)
- topic + outcome present
- valid archive reference path
- concise but specific text

### 8) Apply Writes by Mode

#### If `READ_ONLY_MODE=true`
- Do **not** call:
  - `archive`
  - `update-observations`
- Produce a dry-run report of what would be archived and estimated token savings.
- Still write dream log via script with `dry_run: true`.
- Still write metrics JSON with `dry_run: true` and `validation_passed` based on simulated checks.

#### If `READ_ONLY_MODE=false`
1. Write archive file:
   - pipe JSON payload to:
   - `dream-cycle.sh archive memory/archive/observations/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Build a new observations file with retained items + hooks, save temp file in workspace.
3. Apply update atomically:
   - `dream-cycle.sh update-observations <temp-file-path>`
4. Write dream log:
   - `dream-cycle.sh write-log memory/dream-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
5. Write metrics JSON:
   - `dream-cycle.sh write-metrics research/dream-cycle-metrics/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### 9) Validate and Fail Safe
Run:
- `dream-cycle.sh validate`

If validation fails in write mode:
1. Run `dream-cycle.sh rollback`
2. Write dream log as failure (`❌ FAILED — Fail-safe triggered`)
3. Exit with clear error summary

In read-only mode, never rollback because no memory mutation should occur.

### 9b) Night 3 Decision Gate (for go-live recommendation)
In your final summary, explicitly report PASS/FAIL for these gates:
- `critical_false_archives == 0`
- `tokens_after < 8000`
- `reduction_pct >= 10`

If any gate fails, recommendation must be: **hold live mode and retune**.
If all pass, recommendation can be: **ready for weekend live mode**.

---

## Metrics JSON Schema
Write metrics JSON exactly with fields:

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "model": "model-name",
  "runtime_seconds": 0,
  "observations_total": 0,
  "observations_archived": 0,
  "hooks_created": 0,
  "tokens_before": 0,
  "tokens_after": 0,
  "tokens_saved": 0,
  "reduction_pct": 0,
  "critical_false_archives": 0,
  "validation_passed": true,
  "dry_run": true,
  "notes": ""
}
```

---

## Constraints
- No edits to AGENTS/MEMORY/TOOLS/SOUL policy files.
- No pattern promotion/chunking in Phase 1.
- Use atomic write flow via script subcommands.
- If uncertain about a borderline item, keep it active and note in `Flagged for Review`.

---

## Suggested Execution Summary Output
At the end, report:
- mode (read-only vs write)
- analyzed count
- archived count
- hooks count
- tokens before/after/saved
- validation result
- any flagged items

### Type Distribution Table — DREAM_PHASE >= 2 only
> **Skip this section if `DREAM_PHASE < 2` or `DREAM_PHASE` is not set.**

When `DREAM_PHASE >= 2`, include a Type Distribution table in the dream log output showing how many observations of each type were analysed, archived, and retained. Include all 7 types, even if count is 0.

Example format:

```
## Type Distribution
| Type       | Count | Archived | Retained |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|
| fact       | 12    | 8        | 4        |
| preference | 5     | 1        | 4        |
| goal       | 3     | 0        | 3        |
| habit      | 2     | 0        | 2        |
| event      | 15    | 14       | 1        |
| rule       | 3     | 0        | 3        |
| context    | 4     | 3        | 1        |
| **TOTAL**  | **44**| **26**   | **18**   |
```

This table must appear in both the dream log file (written via `dream-cycle.sh write-log`) and in the inline execution summary.
